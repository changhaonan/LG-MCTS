# LG-MCTS
> Official implementation of Language-guided Monte-Carlo Tree Search

We introduce a novel approach to the executable semantic object rearrangement problem. In this challenge, a robot seeks to create an actionable plan that rearranges objects within a scene according to a pattern dictated by a natural language description. Unlike existing methods such as StructFormer and StructDiffusion, which tackle the issue in two steps by first generating poses and then leveraging a task planner for action plan formulation, our method concurrently addresses pose generation and action planning. We achieve this integration using a Language-Guided Monte-Carlo Tree Search (LGMCTS). Quantitative evaluations are provided on two simulation datasets, and complemented by qualitative tests with a real robot.
